# Create a host server
I chose amazon lightsail to get started, it seemed to have the best price for a dedicated server and they have decent pricing available for for term research instances as well, which I might play around with more later. 


# Registere a domain name
I registered a domain name with route 53 - amazons domain name registrar. I don't have any sense as to why one would choose a specific registrar, and going with amazon automatically connects anything registered to my lightsail account. 

# Connecting your domain name and server

[Amazon's instructions](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-routing-to-instance) for this worked fine for me with one addition. I had to change the default route from public ipv6 to static ip under the domain/DNS zone - assignments page. After this I was able to connect immediately via ssh from my home computer.


# Installing a production server

flask offers a demo serving environment that is perfect to get things going but it's not recommended for production, or serving outside of your local testing. 


## install list
 
Create ssh-key and add to github, follow [githubs instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

	$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"


## install pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv

[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
[pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv)


 	:::bash 
 	$ sudo apt-get install make gcc supervisor
 	$ git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv
 	$ sudo apt update; sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
	libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev curl \
	libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev

	$ git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv.git $(pyenv root)/plugins/pyenv-virtualenv


Install pyenv's environment variables


	:::bash
	$ echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
	$ echo 'command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
	$ echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
	$ echo 'eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc


## install python libraries

Create a requirements file from your test system

	$ pip freeze >> requirements.txt

and install it on your new server.


## Create a gunicorn configuration file

	from multiprocessing import cpu_count

	wsgi_app = "run:app"
	bind = "localhost:8000"
	workers = cpu_count() * 2 + 1
	accesslog = '/var/log/flaskapp/access.log'
	errorlog = '/var/log/flaskapp/error.log'
	disable_redirect_access_to_syslog = True

## Setup supervisor

Supervisor allows 


## Get a signed SSL certificate

[miguel's blog](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/running-your-flask-application-over-https) has an excellent overview of this process and the [let's encrypt](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=webproduct&os=windows) sites instructions are helpful as well. 

As mentioned in miguel's blog you'll need to redirect .well-known to a directory nginx' user. Nginx' user is defined in your /etc/nginx/nginx.conf file, and defaults to www-data. 

note that I needed to wrap flask's app with [werkzeug's proxy_fit](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/middleware/proxy_fix/) to avoid flask serving http links with url_for. I also need to add X-Forwarded-Proto $schema to the nginx server block

	server {
	    # listen on port 80 (http)
	    listen 80;
	    server_name _;
	    location ~ /.well-known {
	        root /path/to/.well-known;
	    }
	    location / {
	        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
	    }
	}
	server {
	    # listen on port 443 (https)
	    listen 443 ssl;
	    server_name _;

	    # location of the self-signed SSL certificate
	    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert;
	    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key;

	    # write access and error logs to /var/log
	    access_log /var/log/flaskapp/ngnix_access.log;
	    error_log /var/log/flaskapp/nginx_error.log;

	    location / {
	        # forward application requests to the gunicorn server
	        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
	        proxy_redirect off;
	        proxy_set_header Host $host;
	        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
	        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
	        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
	    }
	}
