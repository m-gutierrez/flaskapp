# Create a host server
I chose amazon lightsail to get started, it seemed to have the best price for a dedicated server and they have decent pricing available for for term research instances as well, which I might play around with more later. 


# Registere a domain name
I registered a domain name with route 53 - amazons domain name registrar. I don't have any sense as to why one would choose a specific registrar, and going with amazon automatically connects anything registered to my lightsail account. 

# Connecting your domain name and server

[Amazon's instructions](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-routing-to-instance) for this worked fine for me with one addition. I had to change the default route from public ipv6 to static ip under the domain/DNS zone - assignments page. After this I was able to connect immediately via ssh from my home computer.


# Installing a production server

flask offers a demo serving environment that is perfect to get things going. To
